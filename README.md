# Jolly Eyes
The name of the repository was inspired by the toy story movie(Jolly chimp character).

## Goal of the project
The goal of the project is to provide some basic functionalities, such as fetching and filtering emails, to communicate with and get information from different sources 
that use different protocols. Thus, this project will help to get some basic information about unread emails or search the inbox for specific emails by using APIs.
